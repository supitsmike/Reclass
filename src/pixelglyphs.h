// 5×7 variable-width pixel bitmap font + the handful of fixed bitmaps the
// ribbon icons are
// composed from. Everything here paints in DEVICE pixels: callers hand us a
// painter attached to an unscaled QImage sized to the device cell and we
// fillRect whole `scale × scale` blocks with antialiasing off, so every ink
// pixel is a full device pixel at 100 / 125 / 150 / 200 %.
//
// The grid was 3×5 (shapes traced off the original ReClassEx toolbar bitmaps)
// until 2026-09-06, when the user called the result "not very sharp". It was
// sharp — every ink pixel landed on a whole device pixel — but 3 columns and 5
// rows cannot DRAW a legible digit: `6` read as `b`, `4` as `y`, `2` as `Z`,
// and `U` and `V` were the same glyph but for one row. 5×7 with a per-glyph
// advance fixes the letterforms without widening a single ribbon cell.

// ── Text: Departure Mono, a real pixel font ──
// Replaced a hand-drawn 5x7 bitmap table on 2026-09-07. That table was crisp
// but had to be drawn at 2x to be legible, so every "pixel" was a 2x2 block —
// the user's "blocky", and at that grid a 4 read as a 9 and U was a V.
// Departure Mono (Helena Zhang, SIL OFL 1.1, no Reserved Font Name; licence in
// src/fonts/DepartureMono-LICENSE.txt) was drawn on an 11 px em, so at 11
// DEVICE px it draws 1-device-pixel strokes: same physical size as the old 2x
// blocks, four times the detail, and ~25 % narrower.
//
// The design size is documentation, NOT the rendering rule. "Only whole
// multiples of 11" was the rule here until 2026-09-08; measuring the face
// through drawPixelLabel's own threshold showed it is the wrong rule. What
// actually decides whether a size is clean is that EVERY vertical stem
// thresholds to the SAME width — a size that mixes 1 px and 2 px stems is the
// one that looks broken. Stem-run histogram over "H64" / "U16" / "FN*" /
// "WSTR" (cap height, advance per 3 chars, stem widths):
//   11 px  cap 8   adv 21   1 px x31                  uniform (the old size)
//   12 px  cap 9   adv 23   1 px x18 + 2 px x19       MIXED — visibly bad
//   13 px  cap 9   adv 25   2 px x32 + 1 px x3        near-uniform

// blur). The strip's size does not fit that cell: "H64" is 27 device px of
// advance at 14 px against a 20 device px cell at 125 %. Until 2026-09-08 it
// was drawn at the strip size anyway and simply CLIPPED — (20 - 27) / 2 = -3,
// so both edges of every 3-character label were cut off — while the header
// comment on that path claimed it was "shrunk to fit". This is the shrink.
//
// The size is capped at a REFERENCE label length, not fitted to each label on
// its own. Per-label fitting would put a 1-character "F" at the full strip size
// (cap 10) next to a "H64" at cap 4 IN THE SAME MENU — exactly the neighbouring-
// glyph inconsistency the one-scale rule exists to prevent. The reference is
// the MODAL length, 3 characters: H64 / I32 / PTR / STR / FN* / 000 are almost
// the whole vocabulary, so almost the whole vocabulary shares one size, and a
// longer label steps down a notch instead of clipping. (Fitting the LONGEST
// label instead — 4 characters, "WSTR" — was tried and rendered: it drags every
// glyph at 100 % down to 6 px, where "H64" is an unreadable blob. Making 20
// glyphs mushy to keep one in step is the worse trade.)
//
// "Clean" is pixelFontSizeDev's stem-uniformity rule, measured the same way
